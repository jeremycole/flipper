Flipper is a tool for managing pairs of MySQL nodes (servers) arranged in a master-master replication formation.

A pair of nodes arranged like this is known as a masterpair.  

@section IP addresses
@cindex ip addresses

The nodes will have their own IP addresses.  Additionally, two further IP addresses are provided which can be moved between the nodes by flipper - one for write access to MySQL, one for read access to MySQL.
