Flipper is a tool for managing read and write access pairs of MySQL servers (known as @dfn{nodes}) arranged in a master-master replication formation (known as a @dfn{masterpair}).  Client machines do not connect "directly" to either node; instead, read and write access to the masterpair is managed through a pair of IP addresses: one for read, one for write.  Flipper allows you to move these IP addresses between the nodes in a safe and controlled manner.
 
A basic Flipper system looks like the following:

Flipper is written in Perl, and has been written to be as portable as possible.  It does not require any Perl modules outside of the core.  It has been tested with MySQL 5.0, but should work with MySQL 4.0 and later.
